# SELF-DRIVING CAR

   ## Here We are building a fully functional self-driving car fuelled entirely by Deep Learning 
   
    1. In this project, We will use Computer Vision techniques via OpenCV to IDENTIFY LANE LINES for a self-driving car.
	
	2. Train a PERCEPTRON-BASED NEURAL NETWORK to classify between binary classes.
	
	3. Train DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS to fit complex datasets.
	
	4. We will import KERAS, a power NEURAL NETWORK library written in Python.
	
   ## OBJECTIVE
    
	   Our objective is to predict the correct steering angle from given test_image of the road
	   
   ## Prerequites  
    
	   You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.
	   
	   1.  Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
       2.  Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like pandas, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
